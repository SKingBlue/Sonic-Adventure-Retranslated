Dr. Eggman! \nTh-This is bad!
Huh?
Aaaahh!
What's with you?! \nYou bumped into me out of nowhere...
Oh no, are you hurt?
What the?
EEEEK!
Now what's going on!?

Is that Eggman's robot...?
And you escaped from \nwhere Eggman is?
Alright, don't worry.
As long as I'm here, I won't \nlet even a single finger touch you!
